    <p class="book context">
      This line sets the tone for the first chapter. It announces a spiritual revelation­—that of Nuit­—and frames it within the mystical relationship between Nuit and Hadit.
      <br>Nuit is the infinite potential, and Hadit is the spark of individual experience that explores that infinite.
     </p>
    <p class="BIGbook">
      1.
      <br>HAD!
      <br>The manifestation of NUIT.
    </p>
    <p class="book opinion">
      By beginning this way, The Book of the Law flips normal perception. Instead of saying "I am here to understand the universe," it says "I am the universe becoming aware of itself." 
      <br>That’s the tone Crowley (or Aiwass) wanted to strike: total cosmic inversion, blazing revelation, and zero hand-holding.    
    </p>

    <p class="book context">
      Now that the infinite has been unveiled, Nuit turns to describe the beings who dwell within her: each person, each consciousness, is not a servant or subject­—but a star. 
      <br>It’s a quiet but radical shift: individuality is not separation, but a divine expression of the cosmos itself.
    </p>
    <p class="BIGbook">
      3.
      <br>Every man and every woman is a star.
    </p>
    <p class="book opinion">
      This isn’t about gender­—it’s a revelation of divine individuality. Every man, every woman, every soul is a radiant force with its own orbit and purpose. You are not broken or lesser­—you are a star, complete and luminous, born to move freely in the cosmos of Nuit.
   </p>

    <p class="book context">
      Nuit, the goddess of infinite space, is speaking. She turns to Hadit­—the point of consciousness within every being­—and calls him her secret center. 
      <br>This shows their relationship: Nuit is the infinite outer space, and Hadit is the inner spark inside everything.
    </p>
    <p class="BIGbook">
      6. 
      <br>Be thou HADIT, my secret centre, my heart & my tongue!
    </p>
     <p class="book opinion">
      Hadit is what gives life and meaning to Nuit­—he is her heart (feeling), her center (truth), and her tongue (expression). Without Hadit, she is infinite but unknowable. 
      <br>This line is about unity: the infinite needs the individual point to experience itself. It's also a kind of love or devotion­—she wants him to speak and live through her.
    </p>

    <p class="book context">
      Nuit is not just as space in the physical sense, but as a divine presence that lives within and beyond all things. She is speaking to the individual soul, explaining that her joy, her very essence, is found in union, in experience, and in shared euphoria.
    </p>
    <p class="BIGbook">
      13. 
      <br>I am above you and in you. My ecstasy is in yours. My joy is to see your joy.
    </p>
     <p class="book opinion">
      Nuit is both transcendent and intimate—she surrounds you and lives inside you. Her ecstasy isn’t separate from yours: it is yours. The infinite is not cold or distant—it rejoices when you rejoice. This is a vision of divinity where space is not empty, but full of love, awareness, and boundless delight. That delight becomes real when you live fully, freely, and in alignment with your will.
