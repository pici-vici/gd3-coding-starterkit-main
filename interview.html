   <p class="vic">
    Hello, here’s ViCi and I’m here with my partner Valerie. 
    <br>And I would like to talk with you about your practice of ceremonial magick. 
    So the first question is: What is magick to you?
   </p>  <p></p>  <p></p>
   <p class="val">
    Hello and thank you for the introduction. Magick is basically everything. And ceremonial magick was for me a way to organize myself, my thoughts, my actions, to have a space of my own. A space of calmness, a space to recreate, rearrange my thoughts and my viewpoints to the world or interactions with other people.
   </p>

   <p class="vic">
    Okay, interesting. How would you describe your relationship to ceremonial magick?
   </p>  <p></p>  <p></p>
   <p class="val">
    Without it I feel like something’s missing, I don’t feel as calm or as arranged or as assured as when I do it. When I do it I feel very empowered and very calm, clear or confident about my situation. I’m sure that even if something happens it can never be too bad, and there’s always a tomorrow.
   </p>

   <p class="vic">
    That sounds like a very positive relationship. How did you find out about this? Like what was the way into it?
   </p>  <p></p>

    <p class="val">
    Back in COVID, a friend of mine and me were sitting on the couch watching Midnight Gospel. That’s a Netflix series which is basically like an interview podcast, but there’s some animation happening and some story behind it. 
    <br>There was one episode with Damien Echols, which struck me in a very different, very weird angle because he was talking about magick, but also about some aspects of it that I never heard of or never thought about or never connected before.
    Like he was talking about Jesus and at that time I was thinking about Jesus as this figure that was created by Christianity to basically fool people. But he was talking about him in a very positive sense and he also connected me with other people like Aleister Crowley and he just gave me stuff to look into.
    <br>Yeah, he also has a YouTube channel and I basically watched every video that he has on there. He just gave me insights about very different themes that I never really got in touch with before.
   </p>

   <p class="vic">
    So you started watching more YouTube videos of Damien Echols and how did that evolve into you now practicing?  
   </p>  <p></p>  <p></p>
    <p class="val">
    He starts by explainig very basic things. He talks about cleaning as a banishing ritual. To have a clean space is one of the strongest banishing rituals you can ever do.
    </p>

    <p class="vic">
    Like cleaning your house?
    </p>  <p></p>  <p></p>
    <p class="val">
    Yeah, any kind of cleaning. Like arranging your stuff or just having a distinct place for everything. That everything knows where it belongs. That it’s not messy all the time. Because I feel like every time when it becomes more messy around me, my head is also becoming more and more messy. 
    <br>He was not always talking about just magick, magick, magick. But he gave me this connection of everything is magick and everything can be touched by just touching it. Just working with it.
    </p>

    <p class="vic">
    Yeah, I resonate with that. I would like to know, in what way do you practice magick? 
    </p>  <p></p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="val">
    My practice, at best daily practice, comes down to a mixture of meditation, breathwork and visualization.
    That is in a certain way that has been done for a very long time. Which is a mixture of astrology and astrotheurgy. So, that’s basically a mixture of astrology and prayer.
    </p>

    <p class="vic">
    What does it actually look like? Can you describe a typical ritual?
    </p>  <p></p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="val">
    For you, you just see me basically standing in a meditative way and then drawing some stars around me and standing with arms outstretched. 
    <br>I feel like the earth and everything around me is being saturated with light. Every time I breath in, I bring more light into my body.
    You draw energy from the top down to the earth. And then you continue to the other elements and you bring them kind of into balance.
    <br>In the pentagram ritual you start at the spirit, which is the top corner, resembles the spirit or the source of all energy, and you bring it down into the earth, then into water, into air, into fire and back up to spirit.
    Yeah, so you give it a motion, a balance.
    <br>But that’s not all, which it is about.
    It’s very complicated and very… there is much to it.
    So I cannot possibly try to just bring everything what it is into a few sentences.
    But yeah, this is the drawing of stars, you draw the energy towards something you want to give energy to.
    </p>

    <p class="vic">
    What does it feel like when you’re practicing?
    </p>  <p></p><p></p>
    <p class="val">
    Incredibly powerful, I would definitely say that. You start out by reaching out at the top of the universe basically and bringing light in your space. You start out by bringing the light down to your head.
    <br>And just this metaphor, just to have this visualization, I feel, is incredibly powerful because you make your head believe that you want to draw the best possible energy that there is in the universe into first your head, then your chest, then your right shoulder and then your left shoulder. Just bring it balanced into yourself.
    And this alone feels extremely powerful. 
    <br>In general, while doing it or after I feel very vibrant, I feel my body is very light. Yeah, it feels very good to do it.
    I don’t know why, it just does. 
    <br>I think this feeling has definitely gotten stronger over time. I don’t quite remember how it was in the beginning. I always had a strong imagination, so for me it wasn’t hard to just believe in it and make it happen.
    But yeah, I feel like what I do now, it’s way definetly stronger than in the beginning.
    </p>

    <p class="vic">
    That sounds great, yeah.
    What connection do you see between belief and ceremonial magick?
    </p>  <p></p>  <p></p>
    <p class="val">
    It works around belief because it works. It is kind of like placebo. You make it work by believing, I think.
    It is a very hard thing to describe because in modern culture it is like if you don’t see something, if you don’t see it work immediately, then people have a hard time believing it.
    </p>

    <p class="vic">
    Okay, and how does ceremonial magick interact with your daily life or emotional state? Does it affect it?
    </p>  <p></p>  <p></p>
    <p class="val">
    It sets the mood. Some teachings say that you should do one invoking ritual in the morning and one banishing in the evening.
    In the morning you set your intention on whatever you want to accomplish on that day.
    And in the evening, you banish everything that you don’t want to have in your space, for example a colleague that talked weird to you or a guy that honked at you in the traffic.
    You just want to have it away because it is not longer useful to you.
    </p>

    <p class="vic">
    If I were to look into this, where could I find information on that?
    </p>  <p></p>  
    <div class="image-toggle">
      <input type="checkbox" class="toggle-checkbox">
      <div class="toggle-image">
        <img src="assets/images/pillar.gif" alt="Middle Pillar">
       <p class="description">visual representation of the Middle Pillar</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="val">
    Just google hexagram rituals or pentagram rituals, middle pillar, rose cross rituals or just generally magick, magick with a K though, not just “magic”.
    In magick, people distinguish between magick with a K and “normal magic”.
    Normal magic is where you work with illusions. Like with a rabbit out of the hat… That’s not what we consider magick with a K, the self-development.
    </p>

    <p class="vic">
    So, if someone wanted to start practicing magick, do you have any tips for how to begin?
    </p>  <p></p>  <p></p>
    <p class="val">
    The practice that I’m doing right now is a mixture of meditation, breathwork and visualization in combination with some words.
    But you could start by just meditating. Just by sitting with yourself, with your thoughts and see what happens. See how you react to your own thoughts. See how your thoughts react to you. What happens if you silence them? What happens if you just not think? Or think?
    Just become more self-aware about what you do, what you think, how you think.
    </p>

    <p class="vic">
    And maybe where you put energy into?
    </p>  <p></p>

       <p class="description">Aleister Crowley</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="val">
    Exactly. Like if you just sit there and think about whatever for one hour and feel exhausted, then yeah, think about that.
    And if you are interested in more, then continue. And if it feels right for you, then that’s good for you. 
    <br>But don’t force yourself to do something that you feel uncomfortable with.
    If you don’t feel like it’s working for you, then maybe it’s not. Or maybe it is.
    It’s hard to answer that for every person because everyone is different.
    </p>

    <p class="vic">
    Yeah, you’re right. Thank you so much for answering all my questions. It was very nice talking to you. 
    <br>Is there anything else that you feel hasn’t been mentioned that you would like to say now?
    </p>  <p></p>  <p></p>
    <p class="val">
    Just believe in yourself. Fuck around and find out.
    </p>

    <p class="vic">
    What a way to end this.
    </p>  <p></p>  <p></p>
    <p class="val">
    Thank you for having me.
